### QUESTION 46  
Listen to this story, a boy and his father, a programmer are playing with wooden blocks.  
They a're building a pyramid, their pyramid is a bit weird, as it's actually a pyramid-shaped  
wall -  it's flat. The pyramid is stacked according to one simple principle, each lower layer  
contains one block more than the layer above.  
Your task is to write a program which reads the number of blocks the builders have, and outputs  
the  height of the pyramid that can be built using these blocks.  
NOTE: The height is measured by the number of fully completed layers - if the builders doesn't  
have a sufficient number of blocks and cannot complete the next layer, they finish their work immediately.

### QUESTION 50  
Given array {2,4,6,10}  
target say (16)  
Find the number of possible subsets that will sum up to the target.  
Assumptions: i. all elements inside the array is non-negative.  
ii. You cannot repeat number.  
iii. if 0 is given as the target, the possible subset is 1 i.e {}.    

### QUESTION 22  
Write a program to compute the frequency of the words from the input.  
The output should output after sorting the key alphanumerically.  
Suppose the following input is supplied to the program:  
New to Python or choosing between Python 2 and Python 3? Read Python 2 or Python 3.  
Then, the output should be:  
2:2 3.:1 3?:1 New:1 Python:5 Read:1 and:1 between:1 choosing:1 or:2 to:1  

### QUESTION 44  
Assuming that we have some email addresses in the "username@companyname.com" format,  
please write program to print the user name of a given email address.  
Both user names and company names are composed of letters only.  
Example: If the following email address is given as input to the program: john@google.com  
Then, the output of the program should be: john  
In case of input data being supplied to the question, it should be assumed to be a console input.
