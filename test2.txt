Have you heard of the fibonacci sequence? It is defined by f0=0, f1=1 and fn=fn-1 + fn-2 for n>=2.

This question is about a similar sequence, called gibonacci sequence. It is defined by g0 = x, g1 = y and gn = gn-1 - gn-2 for n >= 2.

Different possible starting values of the gibonacci sequence may lead to different gibonacci sequences.

You are given three arguments: n, x, y. Your task is to find gn using the above definition of a gibonacci sequence starting with g0 = x, g1 = y.

Write a function gibonacci(n,x,y) that takes in 3 arguments.

Inputs
It is guaranteed that n,x,y are integers and 0 <= n, x, y <= 1000000000

Outputs
gibonacci(n,x,y) should return gn given that g0 = x, g1 = y.
